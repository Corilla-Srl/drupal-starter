core_version_requirement: ^8 || ^9

# Optional: Declare your installation profile as a distribution
# This will make the installer auto-select this installation profile.
# The distribution_name property is used in the installer and other places as
# a label for the software being installed.
#distribution:
#  name: Distribution Name
# If you want your distribution to pre-select a language you can specify
# the language code, as well. This will prevent the user from selecting
# a language code in the user interface. While not recommended for generic
# community distributions, this can be very useful for distributions that
# are tailored to a language-specific audience (for example government
# institutions in a certain country) but also site-specific installation
# profiles. Note that this language code will also be used when installing
# the site via Drush.
#
# To set your theme as the theme for the distribution installation uncomment the following:
#
# install:
#   theme: my_theme
#  langcode: de
